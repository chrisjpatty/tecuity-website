Hyde Park, UT - Tecuity, Inc. is pleased to announce that the Montana Secretary of State's Office recently rolled out the Notary/Apostille module for the SOS Enterprise Platform.  This roll out took place on December 17, 2019, adding to Montana's Online Business Services.  

SOS Enterprise is a platform with additional modules that can be added.  These additional modules are turned on once configured to the State specifications.  The Montana Secretary of State will be deploying Business Entity in the Spring of 2020.  

Regarding the roll out of the Notary module, Montana Deputy Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen stated, "The new online notary system makes the commissioning process much faster and easier for Montana's 16,000 notaries.  In addition to being available 24/7, the notary system will reduce errors and eliminate lengthy delays.  Many notaries will complete the process and have their certificate in hand in less than two or three days."
