Hyde Park, UT -  Tecuity, Inc. is excited to announce that the North Dakota Secretary of State's office recently rolled out Tecuity's SOS Enterprise Platform coined "FirstStop" on January 16th.  FirstStop comprises many new online services that will streamline business interaction with the North Dakota Secretary of State including:  Business Registration, Trademarks, Contractor Licensing, and Lobbyist; with other modules following throughout the year.

Regarding the roll out of FirstStop, North Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger stated, "FirstStop is a positive and significant change for how businesses and others interact with the Secretary of State’s office in North Dakota.  Rather than a paper-based filing process, online services are available twenty-four hours a day for businesses and individuals.  Tecuity developed functionality allowing the agency to create its online filing “wizards” to enhance the filing experience for its customers and increase agency productivity.   I am very pleased with the partnership and joint effort that my office has with Tecuity in developing the FirstStop system for North Dakota."
