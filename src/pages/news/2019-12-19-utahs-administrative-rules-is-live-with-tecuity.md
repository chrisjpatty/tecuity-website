Hyde Park, UT -  Tecuity, Inc. is excited to announce that on November 4, 2019, the Utah Office of Administrative Rules launched our latest version of the Administrative Rules application.  The updated application will allow rule filings to be submitted online and become more readily accessible to the public.

Recent enhancements and updates to this application empower state agencies to make the necessary changes to rules and leverage technology to make filing easier.

Upon the recent roll out of this application, Mike Broschinsky, Coordinator of the Utah Office of Administrative Rules, stated, "Software development is always a challenge.  As the customer you want to partner with a developer with great technical skills and great people skills.  Tecuity brought both of those to the table in our development project. The result? A technically sound, stable rules management system built on current technologies that gives us room to grow and innovate."
