Hyde Park, UT - Tecuity, Inc. is excited to announce the North Dakota Secretary of State's office recently rolled out the Notary and Authentications modules into the FirstStop Application. FirstStop is North Dakota's implementation of the SOS Enterprise Platform. FirstStop was initially deployed last year. Modules already in use are: Business Filings, Trademark, Contractor Licensing, Lobbyist, and Charitable Organizations.



Tecuity's SOS Enterprise Platform is an enterprise solution that is modular in nature allowing new modules to come online as identified by our customers. The Miscellaneous Filings and Service of Process modules, along with platform enhancements, will be added next to cap off the complete implementation of FirstStop at the North Dakota Secretary of State's office.



Regarding the roll out of FirstStop, North Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger stated, "With the successful roll out of the Notary and Authentications modules, nearly all our business and licensing customers have online options in FirstStop. We are pleased that FirstStop has allowed us to transition from a paper-centric environment to a customer-centric environment."
